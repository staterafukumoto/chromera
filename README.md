# chromera
a chrome looking theme for chimera, and also a tech demo chimera extensibility.

to install you must have [chimera](https://github.com/wayoutware/chimera-browser) installed and have run it once.

on chimera's first run, it will create a folder on your C:\ drive called "chimera-extensions". put chromera.css into that folder. chimera will automatically restart with the skin loaded.
